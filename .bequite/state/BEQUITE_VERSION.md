## How this file works

Refreshed by `/bq-update` on successful updates. Created by `/bq-init` (or the installer scripts) on first install.

Reading this file lets `/bq-update` know:
- What version is currently installed
- When it was last checked vs. last updated
- Which source (GitHub / local) to fetch updates from

## Version numbering

`v3.0.0-alpha.<N>` where N increments per alpha release. Latest releases are listed in `docs/changelogs/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Update history

(Populated by `/bq-update` runs — newest at top.)

### 2026-05-17 — alpha.16 ship — clean stable alpha (skill desc audit + ADR-005 + cross-refs)
- Skill `description:` YAML length audit — 8 over-length descriptions trimmed (now all ≤ ~300 chars for Anthropic Skills activation matching)
- `bequite-workflow-advisor` SKILL.md description refreshed (39→44 commands, 15→21 skills, 3→4 modes — previously stale)
- ADR-005 written: `docs/decisions/ADR-005-claude-code-hooks-for-machine-enforcement.md` — proposes opt-in Claude Code hooks for machine-enforcement of safety rules (banned weasel words, secret scan, destructive op block). Implementation deferred to alpha.17+
- Cross-references added between architecture docs: MEMORY_FIRST_BEHAVIOR ↔ token-saver / delegate / research; RESEARCH_DEPTH_STRATEGY ↔ deep / fast / delegate; MULTI_MODEL_PLANNING_STRATEGY now points at Delegate Mode as the operationalized cross-session form
- No new features; no Studio reintroduced; lightweight direction preserved

### 2026-05-17 — alpha.15 ship — mechanical-repair release (audit findings implemented)
- Memory-first preflight + gate-check + writeback added to 16 commands (`/bq-assign`, `/bq-audit`, `/bq-changelog`, `/bq-clarify`, `/bq-discover`, `/bq-doctor`, `/bq-handoff`, `/bq-implement`, `/bq-memory`, `/bq-recover`, `/bq-red-team`, `/bq-release`, `/bq-review`, `/bq-scope`, `/bq-test`, `/bq-verify`)
- `## When NOT to use this skill` + `## Quality gate` added to 19 skills (everyone except delegate-planner + updater which already had both)
- 2 new red-team angles: supply-chain (PhantomRaven / Shai-Hulud) + prompt-injection (OWASP LLM Top 10 #1) — total now 10 angles
- 9 stale top-level docs + 9 docs/audits/* + 2 docs/RELEASES/* + 1 docs/merge/* moved to `docs/legacy/`
- `docs/legacy/README.md` created explaining the archive
- `LIGHTWEIGHT_SKILL_PACK_ARCHITECTURE.md` counts refreshed (44 commands / 21 skills / 4 modes / orthogonal workflows)
- `.bequite/MEMORY_INDEX.md` created (new orientation doc for every directory under `.bequite/`)
- `docs/runbooks/USING_BEQUITE_COMMANDS.md` extended with walkthroughs for all 4 operating modes + Presentation Builder + `/bq-auto` + the global feature-addition rule
- `bequite-workflow-advisor` SKILL.md updated to know all 44 commands + 21 skills + 4 modes (was outdated at 39 / 15)
- No new features; no Studio reintroduced; lightweight direction preserved

### 2026-05-17 — alpha.14 ship — discipline restoration

- Global feature-addition rule codified in CLAUDE.md + WORKFLOW_GATES.md + COMMAND_CATALOG.md

- Orthogonal workflows section added (Presentation / Job / Money / Suggest don't change mode)
- `/bq-add-feature` marked as deprecated alias for `/bq-feature`
- `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` Q1-Q3 closed (resolved by ADR-001/004)
